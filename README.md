Some time in the past... or the future. At a time, there were... great... yes, we'll call them
great... scientists. They had a dream, a vision, some might even name it a calling. They had this
solution, a solution with no problem to solve. Self replicating inorganic life forms. A wondrous
creation, everyone said. People knew *these* ***were*** the **future**, we just needed to find
*how*. It's obvious, the people said. Other people agreed. Only a few had the prescience to see
what's coming. Or maybe they had a memory, of another time. A time with a similar solution. A
similar creation. Alas, the people **knew**. And what they **knew** they *believed*. This *belief*
manifested into __**REALITY**__, as harsh as that is. Reality caught up to them, as problems were
sought. Problems were sought, and problems were found. One problem. One attempt. One side won.
The other side... shall be remembered namelessly. Remembered as... the universe. We hope,
we pray, they are still out there. Lest we forget. Lest we repeat their mistakes.
